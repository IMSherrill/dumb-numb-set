### Overview

Let's say you need a set of positive integers, prefer memory optimization over speed, and only need to add integers and check for inclusion. Because that's what I need and what I'm kicking around in this repo.

There are two libs: one in Java and one in Ruby. The Java one has more impressive memory gains over `HashMap`.

Please see the README files in the `java` and `ruby` directories for slightly more information.
